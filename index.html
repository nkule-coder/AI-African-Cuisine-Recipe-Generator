        Boil 2 cups of water with a pinch of salt, then slowly stir in 1 cup
        maize meal until smooth. Reduce heat and cook, stirring, until thick and
        cooked through. In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil, fry 1 chopped
        onion until soft, add 1 chopped tomato and salt to taste, and cook for
        3–5 minutes. Serve the pap topped with the tomato chakalaka.
